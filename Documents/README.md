# NUCLEO-L152RE Nucleo-64 board

## Overview

The STM32 Nucleo-64 board provides an affordable and flexible way for users to try out new concepts and build prototypes with the STM32 microcontroller, which provide various combinations of performance, power consumption, and features ARDUINOÂ® Uno V3 connectivity and ST morpho headers provide an easy means of expanding the functionality of the Nucleo open development platform with a wide choice of specialized shields.

The STM32 Nucleo-64 boards do not require any separate probe, as they integrate the ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer.
